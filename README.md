# STOCK MARKET PREDICTOR (SMP)
***
A stock market predictor to make your life easier by predicting the opening price for a given day, based off the opening prices over the past few days (read months). Have fun growing your investments!

## LIST OF THINGS TO BE COMPLETED:

### Data Collection:
1. Compile together a CSV list of stocks whose data is to be scraped.
2. Scrape the web to identify the opening prices for the past year, for the stocks in the CSV list above. The retrieved data should be a dictionary that contains the name of the stock, the date for which the opening price was retrieved, and the opening price for that day.
3. Convert the dictionaries thus obtained into a CSV.

### Model: 
The goal of this project is to identify how well an algorithm performs, given data with one row and multiple features.
If the model performs well, replace the model with a deep learning model to see if it can perform better. Perform statistical analyses on the models to get an in-depth understanding of why the models work the way they work.
Once the models are constructed, build a web interface that returns the opening price for a particular stock based on the past opening prices.
